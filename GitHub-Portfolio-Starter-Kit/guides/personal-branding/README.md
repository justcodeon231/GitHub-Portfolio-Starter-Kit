In this guide, we’ll show you how to leverage GitHub to build your personal brand and make a lasting impact. 💥

People don’t just want to see your finished projects. They want to see your growth! Share your learning process, challenges, and the steps you took to solve them. This builds trust and shows you’re constantly evolving. 🌱
